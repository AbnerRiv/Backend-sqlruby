SELECT with JOIN practice:

Join the OrderDetails and Products tables, to show a report where the columns are OrderID, ProductName, and Quantity.
Paste the SQL statement you used below.

SELECT od.OrderID, p.ProductName, od.Quantity FROM Products AS p
INNER JOIN OrderDetails AS od ON p.ProductID = od.productID;


Join the Orders, OrderDetails, and Employees tables to return a report with with the EmployeeName, ProductID, and Quantity.
Paste the SQL statement you used below. Hint: EmployeeName is not a column in the Employee table, but you can generate a
report with EmployeeName by starting your SQL this way: SELECT (Employees.FirstName || " " || Employees.LastName) AS EmployeeName,

SELECT e.FirstName || " " || e.LastName AS EmployeeName, od.ProductID, od.Quantity FROM Employees AS e
LEFT OUTER JOIN Orders AS o ON e.EmployeeID = o.EmployeeID
LEFT OUTER JOIN OrderDetails AS od ON o.OrderID = od.OrderID;
